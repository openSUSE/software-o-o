  <p> Join the fast-growing community putting openSUSE into more hands by
  ordering the latest PromoDVD for your group, non-profit organization or event.
  </p>

  <p> Promo DVDs help to increase awareness and visibility of openSUSE at events
  like LUG meetings, installfests, and conferences. We also ship to schools,
  universities and for training purposes.
  </p>

  <h3>Keep us informed</h3>
  <p> We would like you to keep us informed about your usage of the DVDs so we
  can help you promoting your organization, event or school on our
  <a href="http://news.opensuse.org" alt="news.opensuse.org" title="news.opensuse.org">news page</a>
  or other resources. (Hint!  We love photos.  Take lots of them!). Please can
  contact us at <a href="mailto:opensuse-marketing@opensuse.org">opensuse-marketing@opensuse.org</a>
  to discuss promotion and/or other ways we can assist you.
  </p>

  <h3>Leaflets, posters, press-kits - other marketing stuff</h3>
  <p> We have a lot of other marketing material to download. Check out the
  <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Marketing_materials">marketing materials page</a>
  in our wiki. 

  <h3>openSUSE Launch Parties</h3>
  <p> One special request if you are organizing a openSUSE launch party: Please
  make that clear in the "Reason" field below and ensure that your event is listed
  on the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_parties">Launch Parties page</a>!
  And if you need help on organizing a launch party, check
  <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Launch_party_HOWTO">the Launch party how-to</a>.
  You can find some cool posters and other artwork on that page as well.

  <h2>Before You Place an Order:</h2>

  <p> 
    <b>Personal Use:</b> Unfortunately, due to the cost and time
    involved in shipping and handling, we can only send in bulk.  We are
    unable to respond to requests for DVDs for personal use for <em>any
    reason</em> (including your terrible internet connection). To get a DVD
    for yourself, please visit
    <a href="http://software.opensuse.org">software.opensuse.org</a>.
    If your connection is too slow, contact your
    <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Ambassadors_list">local Ambassador</a>
    for an event in your area where you can get a free copy.  And, if you
    don't have a local Ambassador, consider becoming one. We'd love to have
    you in our community.
  </p>

  <p>

    for resale. If you wish to sell openSUSE versions, please

  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Cost:</b>The PromoDVDs, material and shipment is sponsored by
