        <%= link_to 'openSUSE Tumbleweed', tumbleweed_distributions_path %>
        is a <strong>rolling-release</strong>. This means the software is always
        the latest stable versions available from the openSUSE Project. Things
        will change regularly as Free and Open Source projects continually
        release new versions of their software.<br> Tumbleweed is recommended
        for <strong>Developers</strong>, <strong>openSUSE Contributors</strong>,
        and <strong>Linux/FOSS Enthusiasts</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <%= link_to 'openSUSE Leap', leap_distributions_path %>
        is a <strong>regular-release</strong>. This means it releases
        <a  href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap"> annually</a>,
        with security and stability updates being the priority during each release
        <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Lifetime">lifetime</a>. It is not expected
        to change in any significant way until its next annual release.
        <br />
        Leap shares a Common Base System with
        <a href="https://www.suse.com/products/server/">SUSE Linux Enterprise</a>,
        so major architectural changes are not expected for several years, aligned
        with each new Major Release (eg 12, 13, etc) of SUSE Linux Enterprise.
        <br />
        Leap is recommended for <strong>Sysadmins</strong>, <strong>Enterprise
        Developers</strong>, and <strong>‘Regular’ Desktop Users</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both distributions are well tested by
        <a href="https://openqa.opensuse.org">openQA</a> as well as by human
        openSUSE contributors so both can be relied upon to work.
        <br>
        Both distributions are fully capable of being used on a Desktop PC,
        laptop, server, or in the cloud.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>If you are still not sure, download
          <%= link_to 'openSUSE Leap', leap_distributions_path %>
        </strong>
        <br>
        It is easy to <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Tumbleweed_upgrade">
        switch to openSUSE Tumbleweed</a> if you change your mind later.
